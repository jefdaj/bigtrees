Create and manipulate hash trees representing collections of files.

Usage:
  bigtrees [-v] info <path>..
  bigtrees [-v] find <tree>.. [<condition>..]

  bigtrees [-vc]  oldcat    <path>...
  bigtrees [-vc]  oldhash   [-e <exclude>] [-t <txt>] <path>...
  bigtrees [-vc]  olddiff   <old> <new>
  bigtrees [-vc]  olddupes  [-t <txt>] [-m <maxdepth>] <hashes>...
  bigtrees [-vfc] oldupdate <main> <sub> <path>
  bigtrees [-vc]  oldtest   <path>...

Options:
  -f, --force    Change existing files without requiring confirmation.
  -v, --verbose  Explain each step as it runs.
  -c, --check    Afterwards, re-hash to check that all files are as expected.
  -e <exclude>   Read a list of globs and exclude any files matching it.
                 If none given, the list defaults to [".git*"]
  -t <txt>       Stream output to a text file rather than stdout.
  -m <maxdepth>  Look for dupes only <maxdepth> levels into the folder structure.
                 Drastically reduces time and memory use when reading hashes
                 from a file, without affecting accuracy up to the max depth.
                 WARNING: only works on a saved hashes file. No effect
                 when reading a tree of files and deduping them
                 at the same time.

Commands:
  info       Succinct summary of a tree file: stats, etc
  find       Print full paths from tree file(s), and optionally filter them
  oldcat     Decodes and prints each <path> if hashes, and hashes + prints if not.
  oldhash    Reads files + folders and prints their hashes to stdout.
  olddupes   List duplicate files + folders in <hashes>.
  olddiff    Print changes in <new> relative to <old>. TODO take hashes here too!
  oldupdate  Updates <main> hashes with new ones from <sub>, inserted at <path>.
  oldtest    Run tests on the given directories.

Conditions:
  type (file, dir, graft)
  mindepth, maxdepth
  minsize, maxsize
  minfiles, maxfiles
  glob
  regex

Examples:

  bigtrees oldhash "/media/jeff/WD My Book"  > mybook-orig-hashes.txt
  bigtrees oldhash  /media/jeff/dedup/mybook > mybook-dedup-hashes.txt
  bigtrees olddiff mybook-{orig,dedup}-hashes.txt
