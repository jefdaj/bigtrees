Create and manipulate hash trees representing collections of files.

Usage:
  bigtrees version
  bigtrees [-v] info PATH
  bigtrees [-v] find [-m METAFMT] [-r REGEX] [-f FILTER] [-o OUT] PATH
  bigtrees [-v] hash [-e EXCLUDE] [-o OUT] PATH
  bigtrees [-v] diff OLD NEW
  bigtrees [-v] dupes [-o OUT] [-d MAXDEPTH] HASHES
  bigtrees [-v] set-add -s SET [-n NOTE] PATH...

Commands:
  info       Succinct summary of a tree file: stats, etc
  find       Print full paths from tree file(s), and optionally filter them
  diff       Print changes in NEW relative to OLD. TODO take hashes here too!
  hash       Reads files + folders and prints their hashes to stdout.

Options:
  -v --verbose            Explain each step as it runs.
  -e --exclude EXCLUDE    Read a list of globs and exclude any files matching it.
                          If none given, the list defaults to [".git*"]
  -o --out OUT            Stream output to a file rather than stdout.
  -d --maxdepth MAXDEPTH  Look for dupes only MAXDEPTH levels into the folder structure.
                          Drastically reduces time and memory use when reading hashes
                          from a file, without affecting accuracy up to the max depth.
                          WARNING: only works on a saved hashes file. No effect
                          when reading a tree of files and deduping them
                          at the same time.
  -m --meta-fmt METAFMT   Optional space-separated metadata fields to print at the
                          beginning of each line. Options are: "h" (hash),
                          "t" (type), "d" (depth) For example: "ht" -> hash, type
  -r --regex REGEX        Regex filter filenames.
  -s --set SET            Bigset to operate on.
  -n --note NOTE          Replace all hashset notes with the given string.

Conditions:
  type (file, dir, graft)
  mindepth, maxdepth
  minsize, maxsize
  minfiles, maxfiles
  glob
  regex
