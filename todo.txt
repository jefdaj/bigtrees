errata from scanning actual backups:
  bigtrees find --types E doesn't show anything, despite lots of errors in file
  are broken (annex) links being turned into "E no such file or directory"?

--print0 option to add null delimiters? or is that overkill for now?

round-trip to dir bug(s):
  could the all-whitespace dir name in fail07 be a problem?
  try round-tripping just the "problem" file inside it to see
  2 bugs? symlink test should have better errmsg, and writing should create file

use Data.Byteable instead of this "prettyHashLine" business?
did i just rediscover the need for an existing thing? binary instances
  but they don't exist for ospath yet (hasufell has an issue about where they should go)
x test whether you can round-trip ShortByteStrings <--> actual filenames, then bother with the rest
Arbitrary OsPath is probably defined by itself recursively and will fail :(
should i drop using directory-tree at all in favor of something with higher code quality?
immediate solution is obvious: use ShortByteString internally, convert to OsPath only when doing IO!
