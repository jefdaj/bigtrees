use Data.Byteable instead of this "prettyHashLine" business?
did i just rediscover the need for an existing thing? binary instances
  but they don't exist for ospath yet (hasufell has an issue about where they should go)
test whether you can round-trip ShortByteStrings <--> actual filenames, then bother with the rest!
Arbitrary OsPath is probably defined by itself recursively and will fail :(
